# KeyFortress

It's a Firefox add-on that disables the hotkeys on certain websites that you can configure.
For example, I was so annoyed by Ctrl-K on the ChatGPT website that I made this extension.

Hate driven development!

# NAQ (Never asked questions)

Why not have proper UI?
 - Maybe later

Why not add feature X?
 - I don't need it
